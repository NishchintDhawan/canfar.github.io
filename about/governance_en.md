<p>The CANFAR project is opperated by the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre on behalf of the Canadian astronomy research community. Enhancement and allocation of the capacity of CANFAR (both opperational and resource related) are overseen by the Science Management Committee (SMC).  The SMC is composed of researchers who are leading projects that make use of and rely on the cababilities of the CANFAR platform. The chair of the SMC rotates between the SMC members.  In addition, one member of the SMC serves as the lead of the Compute Canada resource allocation request, which is the cyber-infrastruction resource that makes CANFAR possible.  The SMC meetings periodically, normally at least once per year in person at the CASCA meeting and at other times via teleconference, when  issues arrise, such as the opperator (CADC) requesting direction on significant technology choices.</p>
