      <p>Since we do try to reserve access to our archives to active
        researchers, our
        registration procedure is not automatic. New users are
        manually added to our
        database and are normally sent account information by
        e-mail within one business
        day of the submission of the request form. If you do not
        receive this notice in
        a timely fashion please do not hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@canfar.net">contact us</a>.</p>
