The Next Generation Virgo Cluster Survey [NGVS](http://astrowww.phys.uvic.ca/~lff/NGVS/Home.html) is  Large Programme for the Canada French Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The NGVS will use 771 hours of CFHT time (approx. 140 nights), spread equally over the  2009A-2012A semesters, to image the Virgo Cluster - the dominant mass concentration in the local universe and the largest collection of galaxies within â‰ˆ35 Mpc - from its core to virial radius, in five filters (u,g,r,i,z), to unprecedented depths.  

The NGVS will be the state-of-the-art optical survey of a low-redshift cluster environment for years to come. It will also offer a wealth of synergistic opportunities with the many on-going and planned surveys of the Virgo Cluster at longer and shorter wavelengths. The purpose of this web-page is to initiate such opportunities by providing some basic information about the NGVS. As the survey progresses, this webpage will be expanded to include real time information about the data acquisition and processing.

The NGVS team comprises 45 members at Universities and research institutes across North America and  Europe.

A short description of the institute and project.



### CANFAR current activities

The NGVS team uses CANFAR services for:

* Data Storage and sharing on VOSpace 
* Batch and interactive cloud processing using OpenStack
* Graphical data search using custom interfaces

### Data & software needs and future plans

* NVGS needs improved management and sharing tools for catalogues of derived science parameters 
* NGVS needs improved integration of postage stamp presentation with catalogue query
* NGVS needs improvements in the cloud processing interface
