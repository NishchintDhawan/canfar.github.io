<h2> Gould Belt Survey </h2>

The Gould Belt Legacy Survey [GBS]http://tinyurl.com/hp4u9ku used two JCMT survey instruments (SCUBA-2 and HARP to survey nearby star-forming regions (D < 500 pc). The survey includes the best known Gould’s Belt clouds – Orion, Taurus, Perseus, Serpens and Ophiuchus – as well as less well-studied local star-forming regions, and complements similar Gould Belt surveys with the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes. The SCUBA-2 targets are half-degree regions preselected on Herschel 500 micron emission to provide a deep, uniform 850 micron survey at 14" FWHM resolution.  Data at 450 microns at 9” FWHM resolution were also acquired in locations of high surface density of protostellar objects.  The HARP observations focus on subregions of the same clouds in 12CO(3-2), 13CO(3-2) and C18O(3-2). The science goals of the GBS are:

<ul>
   <li>Protostellar lifetimes and accretion rates;</li>
    <li>Origin of the IMF and brown dwarfs;</li>
   <li> Structure of cores to clouds;</li>
   <li> Evolutionary Classification</li>
   <li> Mass ejection and accretion rates;</li>
    <li>Core kinematics;</li>
    <li>Clouds and filaments;</li>
    <li>Tests of the standard model of star formation;</li>
    <li>Large scale turbulence.</li>
    </ul>
