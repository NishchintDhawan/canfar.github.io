<h2> Gould Belt Survey </h2>

The Gould Belt Legacy Survey (GBS) is using three JCMT survey instruments (SCUBA-2, HARP and POL-2) to survey nearby star-forming regions (D < 500 pc). The survey includes the best known Gould’s Belt clouds – Orion, Taurus, Perseus, Serpens and Ophiuchus – as well as less well-studied local star-forming regions, and complements similar Gould Belt surveys with the Spitzer and Herschel space telescopes. The SCUBA-2 targets are half-degree regions preselected on Herschel 500 micron emission to provide a deep, uniform 450/850 micron survey. The HARP observations focus on subregions of the same clouds in 12CO, 13CO and C18O. The polarisation component of the survey is awaiting POL-2 commissioning. The science goals of the GBS are:

<ul>
<li>Protostellar lifetimes and accretion rates;</li>
<li>Origin of the IMF and brown dwarfs;</li>
<li>Structure of cores to clouds;</li>
<li>Evolutionary Classification</li>
<li>Mass ejection and accretion rates;</li>
<li>Core kinematics;</li>
<li>Clouds and filaments;</li>
<li>Tests of the standard model of star formation;</li>
<li>Models of magnetic field geometry, strength and the Chandrasekhar-Fermi method;</li>
<li>Large scale magnetic fields and turbulence.</li>
</ul>
