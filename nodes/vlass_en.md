<h5> VLASS status update for July 2016 </h5>

The VLASS Pilot Survey has been defined by NRAO and the SSG to cover ~2400 square degrees, and 200 hours has been allocated to these observations by the Time Allocation Committee and the NRAO Assistant Director for NM Operations.   Test observations began in June under the TSKY0001 project code.  NRAO staff are currently working on an issue with the pointing metadata, and specialized data reduction scripts are currently required to image these data.  When the pointing problem has been fixed and validated, raw visibility data from the pilot will be immediately available through the NRAO archive under project code TVPILOT. Data products (calibrated visibility data, images) will be made available after undergoing quality assurance.

The Canadian effort on VLASS is led by Erik Rosolowsky of the University of Alberta.
