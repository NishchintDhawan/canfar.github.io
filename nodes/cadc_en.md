<h4> Institution(s) </h4>

The CADC node of CANFAR is located at the Dominion Astrophysical Observatory in Victora and is part of the National research Council. CADC provides scientific direction, operations support, and development support to the CANFAR platform. A primary function is supporting users of the the CANFAR platform where CADC is the first point of contact for Issue Tracking and resolution.

The CADC has been involved in all of the CANFAR proposals developed up to the present time and has provided key technical inputs and advice to that process.

<h4>The C3TP project (CANFAR-CADC-COMPUTE CANADA Transition Project)</h4>

The CADC is currently (2015-2018) engaged in a $2.5 million co-development project with Compute Canada to develop and deploy CANFAR services on Compute Canada and to shift major operational responsibilities from CADC to Compute Canada. Half of the budget is being spent within CADC and half is directed to Compute Canada through a contract to develop services that will support CANFAR. The delivery of those services to the astronomy community will continue to be done through the Compute Canada Resource Allocation process.
