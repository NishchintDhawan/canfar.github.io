The international [Nucleosynthesis Grid (NuGrid)](http://www.nugridstars.org) collaboration creates scientific simulation codes and simulation data sets for the origin of the elements. 


### CANFAR current activities
* NuGrid has developed within CANFAR the _**W**eb-**E**xploration of **N**uGrid **D**ata **I**nteractive_ [WENDI](http://wendi.nugridstars.org), a platform to provide members of the NuGrid collaboration as well as external users analysis and exploration access to the NuGrid data sets
* NuGrid is using the [CANFAR VOspace](http://data.nugridstars.org) for sharing data inside and outside the collaboration, taking advantage of the granular access model _CANFAR VOspace_.

### Data & software needs and future plans
* enhance present capabilities by adding integrated processing capabilities into the _WENDI_ platform
* integrate collaborative tools, such as versioning and collaborative creation and sharing of analysis workflows
