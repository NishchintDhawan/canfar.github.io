_INAF-Osservatorio astronomico di Trieste_ (INAF-OAT) hosts IA2, the data centre for the Italian astronomical archives, a collection of data from a set of ground based facilities which includes TNG and LBT. INAF-OATs is also a node of the European Grid Initiative (EGI) cloud.

### CANFAR current activities
In 2015, in a joint activity with CANFAR/CADC, supported by EGI under the Data Commons task of the EGI-Engage project funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2020 programme, work began on exploring interoperability between astronomical data centre services using International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) standards and re-using the open source software from CANFAR/CADC. The first step in the project is to explore interoperability of authorisation services using the CANFAR group management and VOSpace services. In particular, INAF-OATs staff have adapted this software to run in the European environment, and a revised deployment of:
* User storage service (VOSpace),
* User storage browser user interface,
* Group management service (GMS),
* Credential delegation service (CDS)
is now in place.
The first step in the project has been to explore the interoperability of authorisation services using the CANFAR group management and VOSpace services. The second one will be to extend this interoperability to the EGI environment. 

### Data & software needs and future plans

* Contribute in the building of a global geographically distributed and integrated infrastructure for astronomical data archiving, providing computing resources and services tailored to astronomical use cases.
