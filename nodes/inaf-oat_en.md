### About
_INAF-Osservatorio astronomico di Trieste_ (INAF-OAT) hosts IA2, the data centre for the Italian astronomical archives, a collection of ground based facilaties which includes TNG and LBT.
In 2015, in a joint project with CANFAR/CADC funded by EGI under the Data Commons project, work began on exploring interoperability betweeen data centre services using International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) standards and re-using the open source software from CANFAR/CADC.

The first step in the project is to explore interoperability of authorisation services using the CANFAR group management and VOSpace services.

### Present use of CANFAR services and projects
INAF_OAT have deployed the open source versions of:

  - VOSpace (user storage) service, 
  - VOSpace browser user interface,
  - Group management (GMS) service,
  - GMS browser user inteface,
  - Credential delegation service (CDS)

The backend of these services have been customized to use local database and storage infrastructure.
