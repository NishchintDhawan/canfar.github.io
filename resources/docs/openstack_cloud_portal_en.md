All the cloud services used by CANFAR are the Compute Canada (CC) OpenStack offerings.
We strongly encourage the user to refer to the [Compute Canada cloud documentation](https://docs.computecanada.ca/wiki/CC-Cloud) for reference.

The Compute Canada allocation resources are currently shared between all CANFAR users. Currently the only difference
* a CANFAR user on the OpenStack CC cloud is ```[CADC username]-canfar```, with initially the password as used with the CADC.
* a CANFAR project/tenant on the OpenStack CC cloud is named ```[project]-canfar```
