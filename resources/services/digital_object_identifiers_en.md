A Digitial Object Identifier is a string that is associated perpetually (at least in theory) with a particular digital object.
CANFAR registers Digitial Object Identifiers (DOIs) with DataCite.

About

Nucleosynthesis Grid or NuGrid is an international collaboration of more than 50 researchers in seven countries, distributed over 12 institutions.The collaboration develops and maintains tools for large scale post-processing nucleosynthesis simulations, and apply these to complete sets of quiescent and explosive nuclear production environments. These data sets and research simulation codes are used applied in many areas of nuclear astrophysics and astronomy.
Present use of CANFAR services and projects

    NuGrid has developed within CANFAR the Web-Exploration of NuGrid Data Interactive WENDI, a platform to provide members of the NuGrid collaboration as well as external users analysis and exploration access to the NuGrid data sets
    NuGrid is using the CANFAR VOspace for sharing data inside and outside the collaboration, taking advantage of the granular access model CANFAR VOspace.

Research data & software needs

    enhance present capabilities by adding integrated processing capabilities into the WENDI platform
    integrate collaborative tools, such as versioning and collaborative creation and sharing of analysis workflows
